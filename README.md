## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit342/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

A Habit tracking app which allows users to establish and monitor their daily habits, earning points for consistent completion. Users create habits, setting their desired frequency and associated points. As they complete/progress these habits, they accumulate points that can be exchanged for rewards.

### Pages

- Login page for users to authenticate themselves
- The home page is where users can get an overview of their current habits in the form of cards (cardview). They can press the habits/card to enlarge them and see more information. The user can also create new habits, with some example templates to help them.
- In the user page the user can edit their information such as name, profile picture and how many points they got. They also get an overview of their progress by seeing the habit log, where they can see start and end date of their habit in a schedule form.
