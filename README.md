### Purpose

Our app allows you to effortlessly organize your assignments by creating dedicated groups for each project(assignmentGroup), ensuring all pertinent information is at your fingertips. Inside these assignment groups, you can schedule meetings at your convenience, whether it's via Zoom or on campus rooms for in-person discussions.
You can assign tasks to other members in your group, for example "member X shall complete this part of the assignment" and prioritise the tasks with labels.
Each group stores all resources that could be nessesary, diagram links, assignment pdf, links to discord and so forth.
The current user then has a dashboard allowing him to see everything thats on the agena for every group he is currently apart of.
